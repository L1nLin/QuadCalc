# QuadCalc
QuadCalc is an x-axis intersection point calculator for quadratic functions. When the variables of the function are entered, it will calculate the intersection using the ABC formula (for functions in vertex form, QuadCalc converts h and k to their standard form values and then uses the formula).

# How to use
QuadCalc runs in the command prompt. To select an option from the menus, type the number of the desired option and press the 'enter' key.

The calculator can find the intersection points for functions in either vertex form ( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k ) or in standard form ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ).
To enter the variables of the function, only type the values of a, b/h and c/k. 

For example, in the function 'f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1', the variables to enter should be '2', '-3' and '1'. without the apostrophes.

# Be advised

In order for the calculator to work properly with vertex form, h should be entered with the sign it has in the original function, i.e., for the function 'f(x) = 2(x + 2)^2 + 1', the user should enter '2' into the calculator, even though 'h' technically has the opposite sign since the function uses '-h'.
